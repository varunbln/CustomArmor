# You can add, remove and modify Custom Armor Sets here.
# The symbol & can be used for color codes.
# A few armor sets have already been created as an example.
# The name of each Armor Set must be UNIQUE.

# This is the name of the armor set.
Example:

  # This is the tier of the armor. The five tiers are leather, chainmail, iron, gold and diamond.
  tier: leather

  # Set this to true to give all pieces of the Armor Set a glint even when not enchanted.
  glint: true

  # These are the abilities given by the Armor Set when all 4 pieces of the armor set are worn.
  # Due to this being an example, all possible abilities have been given. Keep in mind you may
  # give as many abilities as you want and don't have to give all of them.
  # You can have multiple entries for the same ability. So to give two permissions, you can use
  # Permission: xxx and Permission: yyy in two separate lines.
  abilities:

    # This is the type of ability. The abilities used here are:
    #   Scale: Increases the wearers size when the full set is equipped.
    #   Effect: Gives the player the effect when the full set is worn.
    #   Permission: Gives the player the permission as long as the full set is worn.

    # Doubles the players size.
    Scale: 2 
    # Gives the player the Speed and Jump Boost Effects at level 2
    Effect:
      - speed: 2
      - jump_boost: 2
    # Gives the player the permission "armorsets.fly". This is not a real permission.
    Permission: armorsets.fly

  # Set this field to set a custom RGB color to the pieces of the Armor Set.
  # This only applies if the tier of the Armor Set is leather.

  # Set a custom value to the strength of each armor piece of the set here.
  # This way, you can make leather armor as strong as diamond :D
